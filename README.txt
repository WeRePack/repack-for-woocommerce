== Description ==

This plugin is part of the WeRePack.org initiative to avoid packaging waste and helps shop owners and their customers save resources.
To do this, the plugin adds a field in the WooCommerce checkout process where customers can give their consent to receive reused shipping packaging. So simple, so effective. And with lots of customization options via filters, let us know if there's anything else you need.

*   Shortcodes `[repack]` & `[repack_summary]` to show your support and savings.
*   Clean code, no ads & no annoying notifications

* `append=""`:  HTML to append to output. Default: Empty string

No! You are not! But you can show your good will and that you are not taking part to maximize profit, but to support the initiative and environment.

= How to set up and customize a coupon code =

The plugin gives you maximum flexibility and accepts all WooCommerce coupons that can be applied to the shopping cart. Just create a new coupon named 'WeRePack', it will be added or removed automatically when you toggle the checkout checkbox.
